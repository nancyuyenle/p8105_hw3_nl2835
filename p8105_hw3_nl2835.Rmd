The Instacart dataset has `r nrow(instacart)` observations and `r ncol(instacart)` variables, which include `order_id`, `product_id`, the `user_id`, `product_name`s, and which location of the supermarket the products were found (as in, the `department` and `aisle`). 

User IDs ranged from 1 to 206209.
