## Problem 1

## Problem 2

``` r
data("brfss_smart2010")
```

``` r
brfss = brfss_smart2010 |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |>

  mutate(locationdesc = substring(locationdesc, 5)) |> 
  rename(county = locationdesc, state = locationabbr, response_prevalence = data_value)
```

``` r

  filter(year=="2010") |> 
  group_by(state) |> 
  summarize(unique_counties = n_distinct(county)) |> 
  filter(unique_counties >= 7)
```

#### 2002 - States \>= 7 Locations

``` r
library(knitr)
kable(states_seven_2002)
```

| state | unique_counties |
|:------|----------------:|
| CT    |               7 |
| FL    |               7 |
| MA    |               8 |
| NC    |               7 |
| NJ    |               8 |
| PA    |              10 |

In 2002, six states were observed at 7 or more locations (a unique
location being a county): CT, FL, MA, NC, NJ, and PA.

#### 2010 - States \>= 7 Locations

``` r
kable(states_seven_2010)
```

| state | unique_counties |
|:------|----------------:|
| CA    |              12 |
| CO    |               7 |
| FL    |              41 |
| MA    |               9 |
| MD    |              12 |
| NC    |              12 |
| NE    |              10 |
| NJ    |              19 |
| NY    |               9 |
| OH    |               8 |
| PA    |               7 |
| SC    |               7 |
| TX    |              16 |
| WA    |              10 |

In 2010, fourteen states were observed at 7 or more locations (a unique
location being a county): CA, CO, FL, MA, MD, NC, NE, NJ, NY, OH, PA,
SC, TX, and WA.

``` r
excellent = brfss |> 
  filter(response == "Excellent") |> 
  group_by(state, year) |> 
  mutate(mean_response_prevalence = mean(response_prevalence, na.rm = TRUE)) |> 
  select(year, state, mean_response_prevalence)
```

``` r
excellent |> 
  ggplot(
  aes(x = year, y = mean_response_prevalence, group = state, color = state)) + geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Spaghetti Plot of Mean Response Prevalence by State", 
    x = "Year", 
    y = "Response Prevalence"
  )
```

<img src="p8105_hw3q2_nl2835_files/figure-gfm/excellent spaghetti plot-1.png" width="90%" />

The average response prevalence (data_value in the dataset) is the
average % of responses across the 5 answer choices (excellent to poor).
There is no distinguishable pattern across years; each state seems to
have variation across years, with the average response prevalence around
25%.

``` r
nytwopanel = brfss |> 
  filter(year == 2006 | year == 2010) |> 
  filter(state == "NY")  |>  
  group_by(state, year, county) 
```

``` r
ggplot(nytwopanel, aes(x = response_prevalence, color = response, fill = response)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = .5) + 
  facet_grid(. ~ year) +
  ggtitle("Response Distribution in NY")
```

<img src="p8105_hw3q2_nl2835_files/figure-gfm/density plot-1.png" width="90%" />

This is a density plot showing the response distribution across all
locations in NY. In 2006 and 2010, less than 10% of responses were
“poor”. In 2006 and 2010, most respondents across NY selected very good
and good.

``` r
ggplot(nytwopanel, aes(y = response_prevalence, x = response, color = county, group = county)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .5) + 
  facet_grid(year ~ .) + 
  ggtitle("Response Distribution by County")
```

<img src="p8105_hw3q2_nl2835_files/figure-gfm/scatter plot-1.png" width="90%" />
This is a scatter plot showing the response distribution in NY, but
grouped by county. The distributions are the same as described above, in
the version where counties are collapsed into the larger state of NY.

## Problem 3

``` r
mims_demo = 
  read_csv("./nhanes_covar.csv", skip = 4)
```

    ## Rows: 250 Columns: 5
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl (5): SEQN, sex, age, BMI, education
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
mims_acc = 
  read_csv("./nhanes_accel.csv") |> 
  pivot_longer(
    min1:min1440, 
    names_to = "minute",
    values_to = "MIMS_value") |> 
  mutate(
    minute = sub("min", "", minute)
  ) 
```

    ## Rows: 250 Columns: 1441
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl (1441): SEQN, min1, min2, min3, min4, min5, min6, min7, min8, min9, min1...

    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
merged_mims = 
  inner_join(mims_acc, mims_demo) |> 
  filter(age>=21) |>
  na.omit() |> 
  mutate(
    sex = case_when(
      sex == 2 ~ "female",
      sex == 1 ~ "male"), 
    minute = as.numeric(minute), 
    age = as.numeric(age),
    education = case_when (
      education == 1 ~ "Less than high school",
      education == 2 ~ "High school equivalent",
      education == 3 ~ "More than high school")) |> 
  mutate(
    education = factor(education, levels = c("Less than high school", "High school equivalent", "More than high school")))  
```

    ## Joining with `by = join_by(SEQN)`

``` r
merged_mims |> 
  group_by(education, sex) |> 
  summarize(count = n_distinct(SEQN)) |> 
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'education'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

| education              | sex    | count |
|:-----------------------|:-------|------:|
| Less than high school  | female |    28 |
| Less than high school  | male   |    27 |
| High school equivalent | female |    23 |
| High school equivalent | male   |    35 |
| More than high school  | female |    59 |
| More than high school  | male   |    56 |

Most respondents had an education of more than high school, with a
roughly equal distribution of males and females across education levels.

``` r
ggplot(merged_mims, aes(x = age, color = sex, group = sex)) + 
  geom_histogram(alpha = .5, binwidth=5) + 
  facet_wrap(education ~ .) + 
  ggtitle("Age Distribution by Sex") 
```

<img src="p8105_hw3q2_nl2835_files/figure-gfm/age dist-1.png" width="90%" />

The shape of the age distribution was roughly the same for both females
and males for those with less than high school education, looking almost
bimodal. For those with a high school equivalent, the female
distribution skewed right, while the male distribution was roughly
uniform. For those with education more than high school, the age
distribution for females skewed more left than the distribution for
males. There was also a greater absolute count of females with more than
high school education as compared to males.

``` r
mims_tot = merged_mims |>  
  group_by(SEQN, sex) |> 
  mutate(
    total_act = sum(MIMS_value) 
  ) 
```

``` r
mims_tot |> 
  group_by(sex) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = total_act, color = sex)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_wrap(. ~ education) + 
  ggtitle("Total Activity by Age")
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula = 'y ~ s(x, bs = "cs")'

<img src="p8105_hw3q2_nl2835_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="90%" />

Total activity for all three education levels decreased with age, but
was highest on average across ages for those with less than high school
education. For those with a high school equivalent or more, females had
higher total activity levels on average as compared to males.

``` r
mims_tot |> 
  group_by(sex) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = minute, y = MIMS_value, color = sex)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) + 
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_wrap(education ~ .) + 
  ggtitle("Activity Over 24 Hours")
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula = 'y ~ s(x, bs = "cs")'

<img src="p8105_hw3q2_nl2835_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="90%" />

Over 24 hours, activity level showed the same patterns across education
levels. There were peaks of activity in the morning seemingly when
people woke up, which decreased throughout the day for those with a high
school equivalent or less. For those with more than high school
education, there were peaks of activity in the morning and in the
evening hours (potentially from working a typical 8-4 am white collar
work week).
